<title>PickUp Fantasy</title>

<body>
We plan to create a fantasy footr team's goal is to capitalize on the popularity of Fantasy sports, especially Fantasy Football,

by addressing the market segment that would like to compete in fantasy sports contests without

committing to an entire season. We will allow users to register a unique ID to our application and 

create a "pickup" fantasy game, or league, adjusting the timeframe to suit their specific needs. These 

adjustable timeframes may be narrow windows, like Monday Night football which includes only one 

game, or some combination of different time slots, up to and including an entire week from Thursday 

to Monday night. Based on the timeframe selected for the game or league, our application will then 

determine the teams playing in that block of time, and import the eligible players on each roster to build 

a draft pool specific to the user's league. The user may then open their league publicly for other users 

of the application to join, or invite specific friends either by sending invitations to their user ID, or by 

otherwise providing them with the league's unique name/ID and password. 

We believe our application will be ideal for a group of friends who are watching a game (or games) 

together, and would like to simultaneously compete in a fantasy league based solely on the game, or 

group of games, that they're watching.
